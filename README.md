# Social_Netowrk_DA
EDA for my Social Network on Facebook 2022

![Social Graph](https://github.com/FaresGh1997/Social_Netowrk_DA/blob/main/Full_Graph.png)

The Task:

Use Network Science and Clustering Techniques to perform Friends Segmentation on my Facebook social network.

The Solution Process:

- Data Gathering: use python and selenium to perform Automatic Web-scraping, the result is two datasets. [The First dataset](https://github.com/FaresGh1997/Social_Netowrk_DA/blob/main/Friends_Info.txt) represents the name, last_name and node_id for each node in my social-network. [The second dataset](https://github.com/FaresGh1997/Social_Netowrk_DA/blob/main/Edge_List.txt) represents the connections among nodes in the network.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): using network science tools and Data Visualization techniques to extract Basic attributes and the network summary,
- Statistical Study: to find out if the network is randomly structured and the closest random graph to my social network.
- Centralities Study: to identify key people in my social network and their importance.
- Agglomerative Clustering: segmenting people in my social network using Machine Learning Clustering techniques and find out if the clusters meet real-life scenario.
  
The Findings:

- Extracted multiple friends that are the most pivotal influence in the network.
- Divided the friends into 4 clusters which 95% matches the real-world clusters.
